# API Usage Guide
Welcome to the Serverless Marketplace API usage documentation. The purpose of this doc is to give users a brief run-down of the different actions they can perform on this API and what to expect from it. As the system is completely serverless and runs on AWS Lambda functions, the first few requests on endpoints maybe be slightly slower than subsequent requests, this is due to the lambda functions performing a cold start. 

Additionally the provided Postman tests can be used to interface with the API. In order to do this, import `docs/examples.json` collection and `test/Cloud.postman_environment.json` environment into Postman. The Cloud environment contains preset variables which work with the environment in order to ease the use of the example requests.

> *Heads up!* 
> All API requests **will** require the pre-provided `x-api-key` header

## Response Codes

The following list provides a general outline for response codes returned by the system
- `200 | Success` : Action was successful
- `400 | Bad Request` : Action was authorized however it is invalid, see error message for more information
- `401 | Unauthorized` : The provided credentials are invalid for the requested action. This is typically in regards to an invalid `Authorization`
- `403 | Forbidden` : The action is forbidden. This is typically in regards to a missing `x-api-key` header


## Products
### Querying Inventory
In order to query the marketplace inventory, the endpoint `/products/query` can be used. This endpoint supports two actions, namely `GET` and `POST`. 
- The `GET` action allows for the user to obtain a list of all items available in the marketplace inventory.
- The `POST` action with a query body such as the following example below
  ```js
  {
      "query": "<query-search-string>", //required
      "onlyShowAvailableItems": false, //optional, defaults to false, 
  }
  ```
The query system will search for items that contain the search phrase. The `onlyShowAvailableItems` field is an optional field to allow users to filter products in the query that are out-of-stock (i.e. `inventory_count` == 0) and will default to false if it is not in a request. 

### Updating Inventory
Additionally an admin user can make modifications to the marketplace inventory. This is done using the `/products/update` endpoint. This endpoint supports the `POST` action. 
> *Heads up!* 
> In order to perform such an action, the admin user would have to use the following adminSecret `Zjg4ZjJlMzItYTEyMi00NGMxLWI4NjYtYmE3OGRlY2Q1MTdk` as an Authorization Header when sending the request

The following body can be posted to the endpoint in order to add/update an item.
```js
{
    "title": "<item-title>", //required
    "price": price, //required
    "inventory_count": inventory_count, //required
}
```

## Shopping Cart
### Creating a new cart
In order to purchase items a user is required to create a shopping cart first. In order to do this a `POST` request should be sent to the `/cart/create` endpoint. The following is an example of a registration request body.
```js
{
    "username": "waldo" //required
}
```
Keep in mind your username will have to be unique. Once your cart has been successfully created the marketplace will respond with the following confirmation of your username and a secret to be used for future authentication purposes.
```json
{
    "username": "waldo", 
    "secret": "<secret>"
}
```
Store this secret somewhere safe, as a new cart will have to be created if it is lost.

### Getting cart info
A user can obtain detailed information about their cart by using the `/cart/info` endpoint. This endpoint supports the `POST` action. 

> *Heads up!* 
> In order to perform the following actions the user's `secret` will have to be provided in the `Authorization` header of the request.

The following is an example of a request from a user to get information about their cart.
```js
{
    "username": "waldo" //required
}
```
If successful the following response will be received from the endpoint
```json
{
    "username": "waldo",
    "totalCost": 50,
    "cart": [
        [
            "Blue Sweater",
            {
                "quantity": 1,
                "price": 50
            }
        ]
    ]
}
```

### Updating the cart (adding/removing items)
To add items to your cart, the `/cart/update` endpoint should be used. This endpoint supports `PUT` and `DELETE` actions. For the operation to be successful the `item` field should be a string that is identical to the name of a product existing in the marketplace inventory or the cart. 
> *Heads up!* 
> In order to perform the following actions the user's `secret` will have to be provided in the `Authorization` header of the request.


#### Adding Items
In order to add items to the cart the `PUT` action can be used. The following is an example of a request to put items in the cart.
```js
  {
      "username":"waldo", //required
      "item":"<full-item-name>" //required
  }
```
If successful, one unit of the requested item will be added to the shopping cart. The following is a sample response from the system upon successfully adding an item to the cart.
  ```json
  {
      "message": "Successfully added 'red sweater' to cart.",
      "username": "waldo",
      "totalCost": 50,
      "cart": [
          [
              "Red Sweater",
              {
                  "quantity": 1,
                  "price": 50
              }
          ]
      ]
  }
  ```

#### Removing Items
In order to remove items from the cart the `DELETE` action can be used. The following is an example of a request to remove items from the cart.
```js
{
    "username":"waldo", //required
    "item":"<full-item-name>" //required
}
```
If successful, one unit of the requested item will be removed from the shopping cart. The following is a sample response from the system upon successfully removing an item from the cart.
```json
{
    "message": "Successfully removed 'red sweater' from cart.",
    "username": "waldo",
    "totalCost": 0,
    "cart": []
}
```

### Completing the cart
To finalize the purchase and complete the cart, the `/cart/complete` endpoint can be used. This endpoint supports the `POST` action.

> *Heads up!* 
> In order to perform the following actions the user's `secret` will have to be provided in the `Authorization` header of the request.

The following is an example of a request body used to complete a users cart.
```js
{
    "username":"waldo" //required
}
```
If the cart is completed successfully the following response will provided by the system
```json
{
    "message": "Successfully completed cart. ðŸ“¦"
}
```
